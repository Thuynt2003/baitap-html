        A potager is a French term for an ornamental vegetable or kitchen garden. Often flowers(edible and non-edible) and herbs are
        planted with the vegetables to enhance the garden's beauty. The goal is to make the function of providing food aesthetically
        pleasing.

        Plants are chosen as much for their functionality as for their color and form. Many are trained to grow upward. A well-designed
        potager can provide food, cut flowers and herbs for the home with very little maintenance. Potagers can disguise their function
        of providing for a home in a wide array os forms - from the carefree style of the cottage garden to the formality of a knot garden.
